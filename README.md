# paired-soil-sensors
This repository data and code for the paper "Paper Title Here", published at [link to where]. 

Please feel free to fork this code and use it in your own work -- just please give us a citation, and make sure to make your code open source as well!

To open the `.ipynb` file, which contains the data visualizations and other analysis code, you will need `jupyterlab` or `jupyter notebook` as well as version 3.7 or higher of the `python` programming language, and a few other packages -- mainly `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy`. Probably the easiest way to get up and running with these is to get `Anaconda` at [link to anaconda website].  

## About the data

The soils used were each slightly different, so here is some general information about them.

[--------|------------|------|-------------]  
[nw | synthetic sand | turf | field]  
[ne | synthetic sand | turf | field]  
[sw | natural loamy sand | turf | field]  
[se | natural loamy sand | turf | field]  
[gr | loamy clay or loam | potato | field]  
[hp | all | none | lab]
